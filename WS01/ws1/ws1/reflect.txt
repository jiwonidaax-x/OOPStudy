In this first workshop, I learned a new name space that did not exist when using the c language. It was my first time learning it, so it was very unfamiliar and awkward to use it. So I tried to get used to the name space with a lot of googling and books I had. As far as I understand, a name space is a space that uses a name, such as a variable name or a function name, and in short, it can be expressed as belonging. For example, the name of A's dog is Molly, and the name of B's dog is Molly, so how can we distinguish it? Both have the same name, so it's hard to tell. So we can put the owner's name to distinguish this and mention it in this way, Molly of A and Molly of B. Therefore, the concept of belonging as if A and B were attached can be thought of as a namespace.
