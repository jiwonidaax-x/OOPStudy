In this workshop, I used the class, which can be understood as the upper compatibility of the structure called class in the c++ language.Variables declared within the class are basically accessible only to functions declared within the class. And the access allowance range can be set through the access control indicator. Public can be accessed anywhere, and private is allowed only within the class (a function defined within the class). Information can be protected using this. And dynamic allocation was also used.Until the previous workshop, we gave a static memory allocation that preallocates memory space. However, we learned memory dynamic allocation to use memory more efficiently.Memory dynamic allocation can be allocated when memory space is needed and returned at the time the user wants after use.When memory is dynamically allocated by the user, it is maintained until the end of the program, so memory allocation must be explicitly released to reduce memory waste (leakage) after memory space use. Initially, memory-related errors occurred because I was not used to allocating and releasing memory. However, as I did workshops, I got used to allocating and releasing memories.
